# AnyDesk

RealmJoin contains the remote desktop tool **AnyDesk**. It allows the access to other computers. AnyDesk can be installed on Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile devices and Raspberry Pi as well.

AnyDesk uses ID numbers to establish connections between two computers. Share your ID number with an other user \(this user needs AnyDesk as well\). This user has to enter the ID number in the AnyDesk menu. When you accept the request, the other user will have access to your desktop.

RealmJoin skips the whole ID number sharing process, because every AnyDesk ID numbers in an organization are linked to single users. An Administrator just needs to know the user and can request for access to the computer. Still the user has to accept this request.

As a user you can select different permissions which you give to other \(remote\) users. For example, you can allow or block access to your monitor, to your sound or the control of your keyboard and/or your computer mouse.

When you use the AnyDesk feature \(via RealmJoin\), it is not possible to start a remote session with external AnyDesk users.

## AnyDesk deployment

Before you can start with a AnyDesk session, you have to do few settings.

| Task | Image |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Log in to [AnyDesk](https://my.anydesk.com/login) |  |
| 2. Customize your AnyDesk client | [![Customize AnyDesk client](.gitbook/assets/anydesk7.png)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/anydesk7.png) |
| 3. Select **Make download link publicly available** |  |
| 3. Click **Save** to confirm your settings |  |
| 4. The **Custom Client Details** page will appear | [![Custom Client Details](.gitbook/assets/anydesk8.png)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/anydesk8.png) |
| 5. Select the following **Options**: | [![Options](.gitbook/assets/anydesk8_2.png)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/anydesk8_2.png) |
| - Disable Settings |  |
| - Disable address book |  |
| - Disable TCP listen port |  |
| - Automatically register alias |  |
| - Assign to license |  |
| 6. Copy or save the **Public Download** URL. You need it for **AnyDesk Group Settings** |  |

## AnyDesk Group Settings

Use a JSON policy to configure AnyDesk in RealmJoin backend \(**Group Settings**\). There are three different policies to configure AnyDesk.

The following JSON contains all configurations:

**Key** = Integration  
**Value** = {"AnyDesk: { "Enabled": true, "BootstrapperUrl": "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)", "Ui": {TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session} } }

{% hint style="info" %}
The BootstrapperUrl is your **Public Download Url** from AnyDesk Custom Client Details.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to split this single JSON from above, in three different JSON policies:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.Enabled  
**Value** = true

and

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.BootstrapperUrl  
**Value** = "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)"

and

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.UI.TrayMenuTextEnglish  
**Value** = "Start remote session"

The following JSON is possible as well:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk  
**Value** = {"Enabled":true, BootstrapperUrl": "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)", "UI":{"TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session"} }

## Backend Integration

After you customize your Client, AnyDesk will send you an email. This mail contains your **Contract ID**, your **License ID** and your **API Password**. Send these IDs and the password to the [Glück & Kanja support](mailto:support@glueckkanja.com). If you do so, Glück & Kanja will integrate a AnyDesk API in your RealmJoin Portal.
