# RealmJoin Portal

Device provisioning and RealmJoin configuration is done with the RealmJoin Portal. Administrative users have access to the RealmJoin Portal. Designed to mirror the style of the new Microsoft administration services, it is the main tool for the management of the RealmJoin clients and users. RealmJoin incorporates the same group based user and policy management experience and uses the Azure AD defined groups as basis for software deployment. 

The default interval for group synchronization between Azure AD and RealmJoin is 15 minutes, while only groups with a defined prefix are taken into consideration. Only groups with at least one assigned user are synchronized \(synchronization interval can be adjusted\).

Click one of these links to get to the RealmJoin Portal:

* [Beta version](https://realmjoin-web-staging.azurewebsites.net/) 

The dashboard provides a quick and beneficial overview. All sections can be accessed by either clicking on the corresponding number or selecting the section in the toolbar on the left.
