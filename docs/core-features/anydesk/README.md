# AnyDesk

The RealmJoin Enterprise License contains a single session licenes of the remote desktop tool **AnyDesk**. It allows the access to client devices including the option to elevate rights by using the RealmJoin LAPS feature. AnyDesk can be installed on Windows and macOS.

AnyDesk uses ID numbers to establish connections between two computers. Share your ID number with an other user \(this user needs AnyDesk as well\). This user has to enter the ID number in the AnyDesk menu. When you accept the request, the other user will have access to your desktop.

RealmJoin skips the whole ID number sharing process, because every AnyDesk ID numbers in an organization are linked to single users. An Administrator just needs to know the user and can request for access to the desktop. Still the user has to accept this request.
